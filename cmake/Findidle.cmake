# Makes it possible to find idle through find_package(idle REQUIRED) when this
# source directory was added to the CMake module path. For instance it could be
# done through adding this to the CMakeLists.txt file in the parent directory:
# ~~~
# cmake
# list(APPEND CMAKE_MODULE_PATH "${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/idle/share/cmake")
# ~~~

include("${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/idle/idleConfig.cmake")
